A website that i have tried to work on the webgl and three.js in react development with
using react-three/fiber and react-three/drei.For the animation i have used the motion library.
The complete tech stack is:
- React
- Three.js
- React-three/fiber
- React-three/drei
- Motion
- Tailwind CSS
- Vite
- TypeScript
- Bun

Note: This is a work in progress and i will be updating it as i go along. Currenlty i have been exploring the three.js library with most optimal performance.There are some issues with performance that i will be fixing.The project is hosted on vercel and i decided to use react with vite.

Resources that i have been referring to:
- Official react-three/fiber documentation and pmndrs website
- Lenis documentation for scrooling and their [website](https://lenis.studiofreight.com/) projects
- I have reading the Maxime Heckel's [blog](https://blog.maximeheckel.com/)
